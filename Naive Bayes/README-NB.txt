1.	Naïve Bayes (NB) Classifier:

•	NBmain.m: it is considered as the engine of the NB classifier; in which it guides the user step by step into the process of loading the datasets (train.data, train.label, test.data, and test.labels), train the model, apply cross validation, and test the model.
•	NBTrain.m: trains the NB model based on the input parameters (train.data and train.labels). The output of this function is the trained NB model. It uses the “fitcnb” function by setting the distribution to multinomial (‘mn’).
•	NBcrossValidation.m: applies cross validation on the model generated by NBTrain.m function. The purpose of this function is to have a better sense of the accuracy of your model. The input of this function are the trained model and the number of folds to apply the cross validation. The output of this function is averaged accuracy of the model.
•	NBPredict.m: runs the model against the test data (test.data) and finds the accuracy of the model. The inputs of this function are the trained model, test data (test.data), and test labels (test.labels). The output is the accuracy of the model.  

Ruuning the Code:
1. Open matlab
2. Open the directory where the m files are saved
3. Write NBmain
4. You will be prompted to enter the path of the data files. Ex: C:\Users\malmardi\Dropbox\machinelearning\ml
5. Now, the program will train your model. A status message will be displayed when training is finished.
6. The program now will ask for the number of folds to run cross validation.
7. The Program will run cross validation.
8. The accuracy will be displayed after the cross validation is finished.
9. Now the program will run your model against the test data.
10. The accuracy on the test data will be displayed at the end.

NBRun.gpg shows a snapshot taken from the command line showing the steps described above.
