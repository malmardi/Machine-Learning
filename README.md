# Machine-Learning
Machine-Learning Course ITCS-8156 
**Description:** this repository includes my work in the machine learning course taken in Fall/2016 at UNCC. It includes MATLAB/R implementation for the following machine learning algorithms: 

 - Naive Bayes.
 - Decision Tree.
 - Support Vector Machine (SVM).
 - Neural Networks.
 - K-means clustering (on paper).
 - Back propagation learning (on paper).
